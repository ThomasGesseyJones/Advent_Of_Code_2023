# Advent Of Code 2023 :christmas_tree:

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written in Python3.8.
Stored here, as a backup and so that I can find them easily in the future!

## Notes on Running To Future Self

The problem inputs and example inputs have been removed from the repository to respect the [wishes](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) of the makers of Advent of Code.
Hence, the code won't run as is.
To get a solution to run, you will need to download that day's input named `input.txt` from the Advent of Code website and place it in the respective folder.

Some solutions make use of packages that are not part of the standard Python library. 
Installing these will thus be required for some day's solutions to run:
* numpy
* tqdm 
* networkx
* matplotlib
